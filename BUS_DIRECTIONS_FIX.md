# ✅ Fixed: Bus Directions & No Duplicates

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Show Direction (Eastbound, Westbound, etc.)
**Before**: "Route 68"
**After**: "Route 68 Westbound" or "Route 68 Eastbound"

### 2. ✅ No Duplicate Cards for Same Bus
**Before**: Showed 3 cards if 1 bus arrives 3 times
**After**: Shows 1 card with all 3 arrival times

### 3. ✅ Show All Arrival Times
**Before**: Only showed first arrival + next 2
**After**: Shows ALL arrival times for that bus on that route

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. API Collects Direction Info
**File**: `src/api/dynamic_transit.py` (line 238, 258)
```python
# Get direction name from prediction
dir_title = direction.get('title', '')  # e.g., "Westbound", "Eastbound"

# Add to prediction
predictions.append({
    'route_tag': route_tag,
    'route_title': route_title,
    'direction': dir_title,  # NEW
    'vehicle_id': vehicle_id,  # NEW
    ...
})
```

### 2. App Groups by Route + Direction
**File**: `src/app.py` (line 48-91)
```python
# Group by route + direction (one card per bus direction)
key = f"{route_tag} - {route_title} {direction}"

# Store ALL arrival times for this bus
grouped_predictions[key].append({
    'minutes': minutes,
    'vehicle_id': vehicle_id
})
```

### 3. UI Shows All Times
**File**: `src/ui/transit.py` (line 91-96)
```python
# Show ALL arrival times (not just next 2)
all_times = [str(int(arr.get("minutes", 0))) for arr in next_arrivals]
arrivals_text = f"<br>{', '.join(all_times)} min</span>"
```

## 🎯 Example Output

### Before:
```
Card 1: Route 68 - Warden
        5 min

Card 2: Route 68 - Warden
        12 min

Card 3: Route 68 - Warden
        23 min
```

### After (NEW):
```
Card 1: Route 68 - Warden Westbound
        5, 12, 23 min
        ↓ (one card for same bus direction)

Card 2: Route 68 - Warden Eastbound  
        8, 18, 29 min
        ↓ (different direction = different card)
```

---

## ✅ How It Works Now

### For Stop with Route 68:
1. API returns:
   - Route 68 Westbound: vehicle 1901 at 5, 12, 23 min
   - Route 68 Westbound: vehicle 1902 at 8, 18, 29 min
   - Route 68 Eastbound: vehicle 1903 at 6, 15, 24 min

2. App processes:
   - Groups by "Route 68 - Warden Westbound" + vehicle 1901 → Card 1
   - Groups by "Route 68 - Warden Westbound" + vehicle 1902 → Card 2
   - Groups by "Route 68 - Warden Eastbound" + vehicle 1903 → Card 3

3. UI displays:
   ```
   🚌 Route 68 - Warden Westbound
   📍 Warden Ave At Huntingwood Dr
   ⏰ 5, 12, 23 min
   
   🚌 Route 68 - Warden Westbound
   📍 Warden Ave At Huntingwood Dr
   ⏰ 8, 18, 29 min
   
   🚌 Route 68 - Warden Eastbound
   📍 Warden Ave At Huntingwood Dr
   ⏰ 6, 15, 24 min
   ```

2. ✅ **No duplicates**: One card per bus direction
