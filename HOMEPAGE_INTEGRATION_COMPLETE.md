# Homepage Integration Complete ✅

## Your Real App Now Uses Homepage Styling!

You **CAN** and **ARE** using the Homepage design in your real project! Here's what's already integrated:

### Already Working in Your App:

1. **`src/app.py`** → Lines 264-265 show featured routes on landing
2. **`src/ui/forms.py`** → Search interface with purple container
3. **`src/styles/components.css`** → All homepage styling
4. **`src/ui/layouts.py`** → Header with logo

### Current Implementation:

✅ **Purple Search Container** (#eaddff)  
✅ **Modern Input Field** (rounded, with shadows)  
✅ **Gradient Button** (purple with hover effects)  
✅ **Sticky Header** (logo + title)  
✅ **Featured Routes** (transit cards)  
✅ **Footer**

### Your App URL:
**http://localhost:8501** - This is your REAL app with Homepage styling!

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `src/styles/components.css` - All styling
- ✅ `src/ui/forms.py` - Removed columns, vertical layout
- ✅ `src/app.py` - Shows featured routes on landing

### Why Not Use standalone HTML?

The **HOMEPAGE_REFERENCE_HTML.html** is just a reference file. Your actual Streamlit app (`src/app.py`) already has:

- ✅ Homepage styling (same as reference HTML)
- ✅ Full functionality (search, location, transit data)
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit elements
- ✅ No iframe limitations

**Your real app IS the homepage!** Just run `streamlit run src/app.py` and you'll see the same beautiful design with full functionality.

## Summary

You **DON'T** need to use the HTML file separately. Your Streamlit app already implements the Homepage design with full interactivity!
