# ✅ Fix Applied: Seneca Hill Drive Transit Detection

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The system was missing **Seneca Hill Drive** intersections near Seneca College Newnham Campus because:

1. **Limited Route Discovery**: Only first 50 routes were checked (fast mode)
2. **Limited Stop Count**: Only closest 10 stops were returned
3. **Disabled Full Discovery**: `discover_all_routes = False` meant the comprehensive discovery path wasn't used

### Why This Missed Seneca Hill Drive:
- **Route 39 (Finch East)** serves Seneca Hill Drive at Finch Ave
- Route 39 is around the 39th route alphabetically
- If the first 50 routes were mostly single-digit or popular routes, Route 39 might have been missed
- Even if found, only the **closest 10 stops** were returned, so Seneca Hill (331m away) could have been cut off

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enabled Full Route Discovery
**File**: `src/api/dynamic_transit.py` (line 49)
```python
# Before:
self.discover_all_routes = False

# After:
self.discover_all_routes = True  # Changed to True to find ALL routes including Route 39
```

### 2. Increased Route Count in Fast Mode
**File**: `src/api/dynamic_transit.py` (line 317-318)
```python
# Before:
routes = routes_data.get('route', [])[:50]  # Only first 50

# After:
routes = routes_data.get('route', [])  # ALL 209+ routes
```

### 3. Increased Stop Limit
**File**: `src/api/dynamic_transit.py` (line 356)
```python
# Before:
sorted_stops = sorted(all_stops.values(), key=lambda x: x['distance'])[:10]

# After:
sorted_stops = sorted(all_stops.values(), key=lambda x: x['distance'])[:20]  # Double the stops
```
