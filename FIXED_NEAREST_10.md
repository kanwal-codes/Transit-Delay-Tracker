# ✅ Done: Shows Nearest 10 Stops (No Matter Direction)

## 🎯 What It Does Now

The app now:
1. **Searches up to 700m** in all directions (max distance)
2. **Finds ALL stops** within 700m radius
3. **Sorts by distance** (closest to furthest)
4. **Takes only the closest 10** stops

### Example:

```
Address has stops at:
- 20m east ✅ (closest)
- 30m west ✅ (2nd closest)
- 50m south ✅ (3rd closest)
- 70m north ✅ (4th closest)
- 80m east ✅ (5th closest)
... (continues)
- 200m south ✅ (10th closest)

Result: Shows these 10 nearest stops
Sorted: 20m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 80m, ... 200m
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1: Find All Stops Within 700m
```python
# Search in all directions (360 degrees) up to 700m
for each stop:
    calculate distance
    if distance <= 700m:
        add to list
```

### Step 2: Sort by Distance
```python
# Sort all found stops by distance
all_stops.sort(key=lambda x: x.distance_meters)
# Result: [20m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 80m, ...]
```

### Step 3: Take Closest 10 Only
```python
# Take only the first 10 (closest)
nearby_stops = all_stops[:10]
```

## 🎯 Key Points

✅ **No hardcoded direction** - searches all 360°  
✅ **Sorted by distance** - closest first  
✅ **Shows only 10** - doesn't show stop at 100m if 10 found at 20m  
✅ **Doesn't care about direction** - 20m east = 20m west (same priority)
