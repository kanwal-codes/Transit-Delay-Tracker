# ✅ Optimized: Real-Time Info for Only Found Routes

## 🎯 What Changed

The system now efficiently fetches real-time info **only for the routes that serve your nearest stops**.

### Before:
```python
for each of 10 stops:
    get_all_vehicle_locations()  # ❌ Called 10 times!
    get_predictions(stop_id)
```

### After:
```python
get_all_vehicle_locations()  # ✅ Called ONCE
for each of 10 stops:
    get_predictions(stop_id, vehicle_locations)  # Reuses cached data
```

---

## ⚡ Optimizations

### 1. Vehicle Locations Cached
- Fetch vehicle locations **once** for all stops
- Reuse the same data for all 10 stops
- Reduces API calls from 10 to 1

### 2. Real-Time Predictions
- Get predictions **only for the routes that serve each stop**
- Example: If stop has routes 19, 97, only fetch predictions for those routes
- Don't waste time on routes that don't stop there

### 3. Efficient API Usage
```
Before: 10 stops × 1 API call for vehicles + 1 for predictions = 20 API calls
After:   1 API call for vehicles + 10 for predictions = 11 API calls

Savings: ~45% fewer API calls! ⚡

## 🚌 How It Works

### For "121 King St W":

**Step 1**: Find nearest 10 stops
- 1. King St West at York St (56m) - Routes: 304, 503, 504
- 2. King St West at Bay St (222m) - Routes: 304, 503, 504
- ... (10 stops total)

**Step 2**: Get vehicle locations once
```python
vehicle_locations = get_all_vehicle_locations()
# Returns: { '1901': {lat, lon}, '1902': {lat, lon}, ... }
```

**Step 3**: For each stop, get predictions for its routes only
```python
stop: "King St West at York St"
routes: [304, 503, 504]
get_predictions(stop_id, routes=[304, 503, 504])
# Only fetches for these 3 routes, not all 209 routes!
```

## 📊 Example Flow

### Input: "121 King St W"

1. **Geocode**: (43.6476, -79.3830) ✅
2. **Find stops**: 10 nearest stops ✅
3. **Get vehicles once**: 192 vehicles ✅
4. **For each stop**: Get predictions for only its routes
   - Stop 1 (56m): Routes 304, 503, 504 → Get predictions ✅
   - Stop 2 (222m): Routes 304, 503, 504 → Get predictions ✅
   - ... (all 10 stops processed)
5. **Display**: Sorted by distance, with real-time arrivals
