# Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **NextBus API Integration**
- **Routes Discovery**: Dynamically discovers all TTC routes from NextBus API
- **Stop Discovery**: Finds all stops for each route
- **Real-time Predictions**: Gets arrival times for each stop
- **Vehicle Locations**: Fetches real-time vehicle positions (lat/lon)

### 2. **Smart Location Matching**
The system now:
1. Takes user's location (lat/lon)
2. Discovers all TTC routes and their stops
3. Finds stops within 500m radius
4. Gets real-time arrival predictions
5. Maps vehicle IDs to their real-time GPS locations

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Fast Mode**: Uses only 50 routes for faster response (~20-30 seconds)
- **Full Mode**: Uses all routes for complete coverage (~2-3 minutes)
- **Caching**: Vehicle locations cached to avoid multiple API calls

## 📊 How It Works

```
User Input: "Spadina and College"
  ↓
Google Geocoding: 43.6667, -79.4000
  ↓
NextBus API Discovery:
  1. Get all TTC routes (200+)
  2. For each route, get all stops
  3. Filter stops within 500m
  ↓
Found: "Spadina / College" stop
  ↓
Get Predictions:
  - Route 506: Bus 1234 arriving in 5 min
  - Route 510: Bus 5678 arriving in 12 min
  ↓
Get Vehicle Locations:
  - Bus 1234: lat 43.6550, lon -79.4010
  - Bus 5678: lat 43.6580, lon -79.4020
  ↓
Display Results:
  "506 - College Station" → 5 min
  "510 - Spadina" → 12 min
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Working Now
1. **Real Intersection Names**: "Spadina / College", "Dundas Square", etc.
2. **Route Names**: "506", "510", "501", etc.
3. **Arrival Times**: "Bus arriving in 5 minutes"
4. **Vehicle Location**: GPS coordinates of each bus (lat/lon)
5. **Distance Display**: How far each stop is from user

### 🚧 Limitations
1. **First Load**: Takes 20-30 seconds to discover routes
2. **Not All Routes**: Fast mode uses 50/200+ routes
3. **API Rate Limits**: NextBus may throttle requests

## 🧪 Testing

Test the system:
```bash
cd /Users/kanwal/Projects/MapleMover
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run src/app.py
```

Then:
1. Enter a Toronto address (e.g., "Spadina and College")
2. Wait 20-30 seconds for route discovery
3. See real-time transit information with vehicle locations

## 📁 Key Files

- `src/api/dynamic_transit.py` - NextBus API integration
- `src/app.py` - Main application with data processing
- `src/api/ttc_data_sources.py` - Unified service layer

## 🎉 Result

**YES**, the system now detects:
- ✅ Real intersection names (e.g., "Spadina / College")
- ✅ Which buses serve each intersection
- ✅ Real-time arrival times
- ✅ **LIVE vehicle GPS locations** (lat/lon for each bus)

You can see exactly where each bus is right now!
