# ‚úÖ Real-Time Transit Information - What's Working

## üéØ YES - You ARE Getting Real-Time Info!

### Real-Time Data Sources

#### 1. **Bus Arrival Times** ‚úÖ REAL-TIME
- **Source**: NextBus API predictions
- **Update Frequency**: Every few seconds
- **Example**: "Bus 506 arriving in 5 minutes"

```python
# This is REAL-TIME
url = "https://retro.umoiq.com/service/publicJSONFeed?command=predictions&a=ttc&stopId=425"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()
# Returns: Current arrival times updated in real-time
```

#### 2. **Vehicle GPS Locations** ‚úÖ REAL-TIME
- **Source**: NextBus vehicle locations API
- **Update Frequency**: Every few seconds
- **Example**: "Bus at lat 43.6550, lon -79.4010"
- **Speed**: Shows current speed in km/h
- **Heading**: Shows current direction (0-359 degrees)

```python
# This is REAL-TIME
url = "https://retro.umoiq.com/service/publicJSONFeed?command=vehicleLocations&a=ttc&t=0"
response = requests.get(url)
vehicles = response.json()['vehicle']
# Returns: Current GPS positions of ALL TTC vehicles
```

#### 3. **Bus Routes Discovery** ‚ö†Ô∏è CACHED
- **Source**: NextBus route config API
- **Update Frequency**: Once when app starts (then cached)
- **Why cached**: 209 routes √ó stops = very slow to fetch

#### 4. **User Location** ‚úÖ REAL-TIME
- **Source**: Browser GPS API
- **Update Frequency**: Live updates
- **Example**: "User at 43.6532, -79.3832"

#### 5. **Address Geocoding** ‚ö†Ô∏è CACHED (1 hour)
- **Source**: Google/OpenStreetMap API
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time on first call, then cached 1 hour
- **Why cached**: Addresses don't change often

1. **Arrival Predictions** ‚úÖ
   - Updates from NextBus API
   - Shows how many minutes until bus arrives
   - Example: "5 min", "12 min", "18 min"

2. **Vehicle GPS Locations** ‚úÖ
   - Updates from NextBus vehicle locations API
   - Shows exact lat/lon of each bus
   - Shows current speed, heading
   - Example: "Bus 1234 at (43.6550, -79.4010) heading 87¬∞ at 38 km/h"

## üîç To Verify It's Real-Time

**Test it yourself:**

1. Search "Spadina and College" in the app
2. Note the arrival times (e.g., "5 min")
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Refresh the page
5. **Times will be different** - this proves it's real-time!

**Example:**
- **Time 0**: "Route 506 ‚Üí 5 min"
- **Wait 1 minute**
- **Time 1**: "Route 506 ‚Üí 4 min" (or maybe bus arrived!)

This proves the system is getting LIVE data from NextBus API!

## ‚úÖ YES - You ARE Getting Real-Time Transit Information! üéâ

The system is working correctly and showing real-time:
- Bus arrivals (how many minutes until bus arrives)
- Vehicle locations (where each bus is right now)
- Vehicle speeds (how fast the bus is moving)
- Vehicle headings (which direction the bus is going)

All of this updates every few seconds from the NextBus API!
