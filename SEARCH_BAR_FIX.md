# ‚úÖ Fixed: Search Bar Geocoding Issue

## üêõ Problem

When typing **"130 King Street W Units CL5, CL6, CL7, Toronto, ON M5X 1A9"** in the search bar:

1. **Before Fix**: Query was enhanced to generic "King Street" ‚Üí wrong location (York)
2. **Result**: Got coordinates (43.7066, -79.5133) in York, ON
3. **Expected**: Should get downtown Toronto coordinates (~43.647, -79.385)

### Why It Failed:
```
"130 King Street W Units CL5..." contained "king street"
‚Üì
Enhanced to "King Street Toronto Ontario Canada"
‚Üì
Lost all specific details (130, W, Units, postal code)
‚Üì
Google returned generic King Street in York neighborhood
```

## ‚úÖ Solution

Updated `_enhance_query_for_toronto()` to detect specific addresses:

### Key Changes:

1. **Detect Specific Addresses**: 
   - Check for unit numbers, postal codes, suite numbers
   - Don't enhance queries that already have specific details

2. **Preserve Address Details**:
   - Keep original query intact if it has unit numbers or postal codes
   - These details are critical for accurate geocoding

### Code Change:
```python
# Don't enhance if query already has specific address details
has_specific_details = any(
    indicator in query_lower 
    for indicator in ['unit', 'units', 'suite', 'apt', 'apartment', '#', 'm5x', 'm4', 'm3', 'm2', 'm1']
)

if has_specific_details:
    # Keep original query - it's already specific enough
    return query
```
